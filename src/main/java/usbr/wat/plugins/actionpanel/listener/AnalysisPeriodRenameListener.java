/**
 * Listens for analysis period rename events and propagates name changes to all
 * simulation groups that reference the renamed period.
 *
 * This class plays two complementary roles:
 *
 *   As an {@link Observer} it receives property-change notifications fired by
 *       individual {@link WatAnalysisPeriod} objects whenever their name changes.
 *   As a {@link ProjectManagerListener} it is notified when analysis periods are
 *       added to or removed from the project, allowing the listener to attach or detach
 *       itself from newly registered periods dynamically.
 *
 *
 * A parallel name cache ({@code _localApList} / {@code _localApNameList}) is maintained
 * to handle the case where a simulation group holds a stale name string rather than a
 * live object reference to its analysis period. When a rename is detected, both
 * {@link PrescribedSimulationGroup} and {@link ForecastSimulationGroup} instances are updated so they
 * reflect the current period name and are marked as modified.
 *
 * Call {@link #stopListening()} when the listener is no longer needed to prevent memory
 * leaks from lingering observer registrations.
