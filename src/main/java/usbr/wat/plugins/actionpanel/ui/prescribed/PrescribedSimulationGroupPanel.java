 * Concrete simulation group toolbar panel for the prescribed workflow.
 *
 * This class extends BaseSimulationGroupPanel to provide the prescribed-specific
 * implementations of the three action factory methods and the combo-box selection
 * handler. It manages PrescribedSimulationGroup objects (as opposed to ForecastSimulationGroup objects
 * managed by the forecast equivalent).
 *
 * Beyond the controls inherited from BaseSimulationGroupPanel, this panel appends a
 * horizontal JSeparator below the toolbar row to visually separate the group controls
 * from the simulation detail content below.
 *
 * When a simulation group is selected from the combo box, the group's manager is
 * loaded from the proxy and passed to the owning PrescribedPanel via fillForm,
 * which also enables or disables the Edit button based on whether a valid group exists.
