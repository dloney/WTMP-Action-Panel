/**
 * Abstract base class for all planning data import dialogs in the WTMP action panel UI.
 *
 * {@code ImportPlanningWindow} extends {@link RmaJDialog} to provide a common foundation
 * for dialogs that collect user input and produce planning data (e.g.,
 * {@link CreateBcWindow}). It enforces a consistent cancellation contract across all
 * subclasses:
 *
 *   The {@code _canceled} flag is initialised to {@code true} and must be explicitly
 *       set to {@code false} by a subclass only after the user has successfully submitted the form.
 *   The default close operation is set to {@link #DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE} to prevent
 *       the system from disposing the dialog when the user clicks the window's close
 *       button. Instead, a {@link WindowAdapter} intercepts the closing event, sets
 *       {@code _canceled} to {@code true}, and hides the dialog so it can be reused.
 *
 * Concrete subclasses must implement {@link #isCanceled()} to expose the cancellation
 * state to callers, and typically also provide {@code fillForm} and {@code getBcData}
 * (or equivalent) methods for populating and retrieving data.
 *
 * @see CreateBcWindow
 * @see RmaJDialog
