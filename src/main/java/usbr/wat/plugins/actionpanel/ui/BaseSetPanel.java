/**
 * Abstract base panel providing the shared toolbar and combo-box UI for selecting
 * and managing simulation groups within the WTMP action panel.
 *
 * This class renders a horizontal control bar containing:
 *   A labeled combo box listing all simulation groups of the type managed by the subclass.
 *   Edit, New, and Delete buttons whose Actions are supplied by concrete subclasses.
 *   An "Update Models" button that is conditionally shown based on the GIT_DASH_D_FLAG
 *   system property, enabling Git-aware deployments to refresh model files.
 *   A description field (currently commented out) reserved for future display of the
 *   selected group's description text.
 *
 * Concrete subclasses must implement:
 *   getEditSetAction()  -- returns the Action bound to the Edit button.
 *   getNewSetAction()   -- returns the Action bound to the New button.
 *   getDeleteSetAction(BaseSetPanel) -- returns the Action bound to Delete.
 *   setSelected(ItemEvent) -- reacts to combo-box selection changes.
 *   getSetClass()       -- returns the Class used to query the project's manager list.
 *
 * Project open and close events are handled via a static ProjectAdapter so the combo
 * box is populated or cleared automatically as the active study changes.
