/**
 * Concrete simulation group toolbar panel for the forecast workflow.
 *
 * This class extends BaseSimulationGroupPanel to provide forecast-specific
 * implementations of the three action factory methods and the combo-box selection
 * handler. It manages ForecastSimGroup objects rather than the standard SimulationGroup
 * type used by CalibrationSimulationGroupPanel.
 *
 * In addition to the controls inherited from BaseSimulationGroupPanel, this panel
 * appends a JTabbedPane below the toolbar row. The tabbed pane is available for
 * forecast-specific tab content to be added by parent or sibling components.
 *
 * When a forecast simulation group is selected from the combo box, the group's manager
 * is loaded from the proxy and passed to the owning AbstractSimulationPanel via
 * fillForm, which also enables or disables the Edit button accordingly. A DESELECTED
 * event with a non-null proxy explicitly clears the parent panel by calling fillForm
 * with null before the new selection is processed.
 *
