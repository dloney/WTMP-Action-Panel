/**
 * Contract that all WTMP simulation panel implementations must satisfy.
 *
 * This interface defines the complete set of actions and queries that the action
 * panel framework can invoke on any panel displaying a simulation group. Concrete
 * implementations include workflow panels.
 *
 * The methods fall into three categories:
 *
 *   Context actions -- operations triggered by toolbar or right-click menu selections
 *   that act on the currently selected row in the simulation table:
 *     editSimulationMetaData, displayComputeLog, showInProjectTreeAction,
 *     displaySimulationInMap, displayReport, displayFile.
 *
 *   Table management -- methods that populate or refresh the simulation table:
 *     fillSimulationTable, updateComputeStates.
 *
 *   Data access -- queries returning data needed by other components:
 *     getSimulationReportInfos, getSimulationTreeTable.
 *
 * All implementations are expected to obtain the currently selected simulation or
 * results entry from the simulation tree-table and delegate to the appropriate
 * framework component.
