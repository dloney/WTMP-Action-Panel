 * Checked exception thrown when a temperature target set fails to save its

 * status code; it composes a detail message identifying the failing DSS record
 * pathname, the target file, and the numeric error status.
 *
 * The single-argument form is used for higher-level failures (e.g. a missing
 * analysis period) where a plain descriptive message is sufficient.
 *
 * Callers that catch this exception should display its message to the user and
 * log it at an appropriate severity level.
