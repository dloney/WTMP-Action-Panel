/**
 * ForecastReportingPlugin is an interface extending ReportPlugin that defines the contract for forecast-specific reporting functionality.
 * It enables plugins to define how reports are generated for ensemble simulations by providing a method to create the UI Action
 * object and a method to execute the actual report creation logic with provided data and options.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface must:
 *
 *   Create an Action object that can be added to the ActionsWindow menu for user access
 *   Implement createReport() to generate reports based on simulation info, ensemble data, and formatting options
 *
