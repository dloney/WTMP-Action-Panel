/**
 * Named data object representing a meteorological dataset within a ForecastSimulationGroup.
 *
 * Acts as a lightweight named placeholder for a meteorological data scenario (such as
 * a historical or synthetic weather dataset) that can be selected when configuring a
 * BcData boundary condition for an ensemble forecast run.
 *
 * The class currently holds only the display name inherited from NamedType. Additional
 * fields for file paths or DSS identifiers may be added in future versions as the
 * meteorological data model is expanded.
 *
 * Instances are loaded by ForecastSimulationGroup from the "Meteorology" XML element and
 * resolved by name in BcData when loading boundary condition configurations.
